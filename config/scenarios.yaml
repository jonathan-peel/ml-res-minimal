# This file is used to define the scenarios that are run by snakemake. Each entry on the first level is a scenario. Each scenario can contain configuration overrides with respect to the config/config.yaml settings.
#
# Example
#
# custom-scenario: # name of the scenario
#   electricity:
#       renewable_carriers: [wind, solar] # override the list of renewable carriers

full:
  electricity:
    renewable_carriers: [solar, onwind, offwind-ac, offwind-dc, hydro]
    extendable_carriers:
      Generator: [solar, onwind, offwind-ac, offwind-dc] # omit hydro
      StorageUnit: [battery] # a storage unit with inherent power conversion; e_nom and p_nom connected via e_nom = p_nom * max_hours so extending requires high investment in both
      Store: [H2] # storage without inherent power conversion; sets e_nom
      Link: [H2 pipeline] # sets p_nom
    transmission_limit: vopt
